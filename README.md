# FIEA-game-engine
This is a Data driven Game engine written in C++ made at Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy. 

In this project I wrote different templeted containers such as S-Lists, Vectors, and Hash-maps to make use of compile time polymorphism. 
As well as implement Run Time polymophishm through the use of Run-Time Type Information (RTTI).

Several different patterns where implemented such as the Observer, Singleton, Chain of Responsibility, and Factory pattern. 

Wrote a simple JSON grammar and deserializer that is used to instantiate objects at run-time.
